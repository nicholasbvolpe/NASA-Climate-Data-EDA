# NASA-Climate-Data-EDA

All of the data used in this analysis can be found here: https://climate.nasa.gov

This repository contains the final presentation for my project for CSCI 4502: Data Mining in Fall 2020.

I collaborated with Alex Fisher, another Boulder student enrolled in the course, for this project.

The Jupyter Notebook contains my portion of the code, and the txt/csv files are the data used in this notebook. Updated data can be found at the climate.nasa.gov website.

Thanks for checking it out!
